      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The purpose of this research is to examine which factors influence linguistic meaning. You will be asked to make judgements about the meaning of sentences in different scenarios. We are simply interested in your judgement. The study will take less than 1 hour to complete, and you will receive less than $20 on Prolific. Your compensation and time commitment are specified in the study description. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would ordinarily experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a mouse or keyboard for a similar amount of time. At the end of the study, we will provide an explanation of the questions that motivate this line of research and will describe the potential implications.</p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"margin-bottom: 50px;>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you may refuse to participate or you may choose to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to you which are otherwise entitled. Your participation in this study will remain confidential. No personally identifiable information will be associated with your data. Also, all analyses of the data will be averaged across all the participants, so your individual responses will never be specifically analyzed.</p>
